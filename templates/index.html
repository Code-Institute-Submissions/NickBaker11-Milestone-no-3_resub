   <h2>Welcome to your Dinosaur Database!</h2>
   If you want to learn about dinosaurs and store what you've learnt, you're in
   the right place! This page will allow you to scour the internet for
   information on these long vanished lizards (Dinosaur means terrible-lizard)
   and store some of that information on our database so that you can look back
   at it whenever you like. Each Dinosaur will have a database entry like the one
   below.<br />

      There are 6 categories for you to fill out- Name, Time Period, Diet, length,
      Speed and Discovered in. To help you, we will explain each category a
      little.
      <span>Name-</span> The given name of each dinosaur such as Tyrannosaurus
      Rex<br />
      <span class="cat-names">Time Period-</span> Dinosaurs lived in what we call
      the Mesozoic Era, which is split into three different time periods-
      Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. You will be able to pick one of these
      three options for this category.<br />
      <span class="cat-names">Diet-</span> There are three types of dinosaur diet:
      Herbivore (vegetarian), Carnivore (meat eater) and Omnivore (eats both meat
      and vegetation)<br />
      <span class="cat-names">Length-</span> Some dinosaurs were very small and
      others were very, very big. Most information you find on length will be an
      average, but if you find a record length, you can put that in if you want<br />
      <span class="cat-names">Speed-</span> As dinosaurs aren't alive anymore, we
      can't measure their speed on a racetrack. However, scientists have used
      amazing technology to get what they believe to be quite accurate guesses on
      how fast a dinosaur could of ran<br />
      <span class="cat-names">Discovered in-</span> This category is for the place
      that dinosaur skeletons have been found. Sound dinosaurs will have been
      found in a few different spots. You can be as specific as you like with this
      category, putting a continent like North America, a US state such as Arizona
      where lots of dinosaurs bones have been found or even a town like Faith
      where the Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton 'Sue' was discovered<br />
      <span class="cat-names">Extra Information-</span> This category can be used
      for any additional information you find interesting that doesn't fit into
      the above categories. This could be anything from "Velociraptor means
      'speedy theif'" to "The Stegosaurus has the smallest brain for its body size
      of any known dinosaur. Its body was the size of a van, but its brain was the
      size of a walnut". It's up to you!
      <br />
      <br />There is so much information on dinosaurs out there. You can find it
      in books at your library, by talking to people or by searching online. If
      you are going to use the internet, you could type something specific like
      'herbivorous dinosaur from the Jurassic period' or 'carnivorous dinosaur
      from the Triassic period'. This will narrow done your search a bit and might
      help you find out about dinosaurs you may not have discovered otherwise.<br />
      <br />
      Good luck in your hunt for Dino Info, we hope you enjoy it!
