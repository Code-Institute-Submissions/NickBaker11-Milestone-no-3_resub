# Title -The Dino Database
This project will be an educational database aimed at children and teenagers with information about different dinosaur species. It will have information stored for them already and will encourage them to research additional information themselves, providing links to sources. The user will be able to add and store information that they find expanding the database.

# UX
* As a user I want to learn about dinosaurs.
* As a user I want to have an organised place to store what I am learning so that I can look at it again.
* As a user want to be able to update and delete the information I am inputting if there is new information to add to what I already have.

## Wireframes
* Here is a link to my wiresframes- https://github.com/NickBaker11/Milestone-no-3/blob/master/wireframes/MS3.pdf. The layout in my final project stayed roughly the same but certain visual aspects within the layout were altered for what I felt was a better user experience

# Design Choices
* As this website is an educational tool aimed at children, I wanted it the appeal to them visually. I tried a few different fonts and colour schemes and felt that the final ones chosen offered the best visual experience. A slightly childlike, easy to read font and a 'scary' colour scheme given the subject matter.
* I kept the layout simple and easy to follow, with instructions on how best to enter information into the database. I feel that the site is intuitive but still wanted to give extra instructions without overwhelming the user.

## Technologies Used 
* I used W3C to validate my HTML and CSS. I when on each page I right clicked, selected View Source Code from th options, then copy and pasted the code into the validator- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ 
* I am using Materialize for layout and navbar- https://materializecss.com/
* I am using Heroku to deploy my project https://www.heroku.com/home
* I am using MongoDB Atlas to store my database https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
* I used Esprima to validate my JavaScript https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html
* I used PEP8 to validate my Python http://pep8online.com/
* I used FreeFormatter to beautify my code for easier reading https://www.freeformatter.com/

## Testing
* Testing my links- In the navbar, both regular and mobile:'logo', 'home', 'database', 'more info'. On all three pages: 'top_return' On index.html:  an additional 'database button that links to main_page.html. On main_page.html: 'add', and 'edit'.  When clicked, each of these buttons sends the user to the correct URL.
* Testing my CRUD 'create'- Clicking on the #add_info_btn on main_page.html takes the user to add_info.html. This page shows the user the input categories. The user can then input the desired data into each - any category that does not have input gets a 'please fill out this field' popup warning. Once the user has finished inputting their data and clicks 'Submit', the data is successfully sent to my MongoDB and the user will then be redirected to main_page.html. I have tested this several times and see the data both in my atlas mongo database and on the website itself as the user will see it.
* Testing my CRUD 'edit'- Clicking on the #edit_info_btn on main_page.html that is linking to each database entry takes the user to the same page setup as add_info.hmtl, except that the fields are already filled in. The user may then edit the desired information and hit the Edit button. The user will then be redirected to main_page.html and the information they wanted to edit will have been successfully altered.
* Testing my CRUD 'delete'- Clicking on the #delete_info_btn on main_page.html that is linking to each database entry will delete that particular entry from the database. As it is removed from the database, it will no longer be visible to the user.
* I have added three filters so that users can only see entries from each of the three preset time periods. Clicking on each of these options and the 'Show Full Database' all take the user to the correct URL.
* All external links go to the desired page on a new tab

## Deployment
* This site was deployed using Heroku. Deployed site- https://dinodatabase.herokuapp.com/
* To do this I created a Heroku account and connected it to my GitHub account. I then enabled the 'automatic deploys' option and then 'Deploy Branch'. Heroku then generated the app and it is now accessible online through the above link. The branch deployed is my master branch.
* There are no differences between my Heroku app and my GitHub repo

# Issues
* I am aware of the linting errors in my HTML files in templates. All of these are extensions of 'base.html' and therefore do not need the boilerplate with DOCTYPE etc. 
* In app.py and env.py I had errors "'env' imported but unused" and "line too long (122 > 79 characters)" respectively. These are both linting errors and do not affect the project so I used the # noqa comment to disable the error warning.
* When a user adds or edits information on the database using the provided forms, a green underline appears. This is a Materialize default that I was unable to get completely change.
* app.py- For my filter options I was unable to get all three into the same app.route and working. I am aware of the duplication and would be want to improve the code in the future.
* When validating my code on main_page.html, many duplication errors appear. This is due to the fact that database.html is inserted into the file using jinja, but does not have extends base within its file. main_page.html is extended from base and having both extending from the base causes duplications on the page. I am aware of the errors and have left them as it is neccessary to have my database.html seperate from my main_page.html
* I am aware during validation that errors come up for a bad value in href ie- href="{{ url_for('edit_info', info_id=info._id) }}". It was neccessary to use this format due to the use of static files

# Future Enhancements
* I would add a register and login function so that users would only be able to edit their database. With that, I would have it set so that the original database I provide would not be editable or deletable by users
* I would enhance the filters options, adding more options. Using checkboxes instead of buttons would alow the user to have multiple fields selected at once.
* When the user clikcs on the 'Delete' buton I would add a pop up box to confirm they wanted to complete this action
